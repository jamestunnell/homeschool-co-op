        <p>The Ellensburg HomeSchool Co-Op (EHC) was established to support the
        Kittitas County homeschool community by providing a variety of academic &
        extracurricular classes to supplement your homeschool curriculum.</p>
        
        <p>"Co-Op" means this is a co-operative effort; moms and dads work together
        to create the infrastructure and build a sucessful learning environment.</p>
        
        <p>To learn about how EHC works, or browse the class schedule, visit the
        links above.  If you are interested in teaching a class, please visit the
        "Contacts" page and email our Program  Administrator  with your name, a
        class description and your qualifications.</p>
        
        <h4>Not participating in Co-Op?</h4>
        <p>If you are a Kittitas County homeschooler, this is still the place to
        connect with other families. Our homeschool community has  field trips,
        park days, learning events, and other fun activities in addition to co-op
        classes. Most of these are posted on the "Ellensburg Homeschoolers" Facebook
        page (see link at top of page), but we will also occasionally post them here,
        including pictures from these events.</p>
