  <h2>Parent Agreement</h2>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I understand that EHC classes are supplemental to what is being taught in
      the home and are meant for enrichment purposes only. As the parent, I also
      realize that these classes will not complete any curriculum, only enhance
      them. The instructors do not teach the entire subject matter, but are only
      enriching and assisting my instruction at home.
    </li>
    <li>
      I understand that EHC does not keep permanent academic records or assign grades.
    </li>
    <li>
      I understand that EHC does not give credit toward high school graduation
      requirements; although parents may use class time toward fulfilling some
      requirements in a given subject, according to the parentâ€™s own discretion.
    </li>
    <li>
      I agree that my children will strive to regularly attend all classes for
      which I have registered them. They will arrive on time, fully participate
      in the class by completing any homework assignments and engage with other
      students and the instructor during class time.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have read the Student Expectations (see <%= link_to "About", about_path %>
      page) and agree to be responsible for their behavior while at the EHC.
    </li>
    <li>
      I understand and agree that I must remain on the premises the entire time
      and be responsible for my children regardless of their age whenever they
      are participating in co-op.
    </li>
    <li>
      I understand and agree that the co-operative planning committee, instructors
      or our physical location will at no time be responsible for mishaps, injuries,
      or accidents that may occur during the year.
    </li>
    <li>
      I understand that a full refund is only available if I cancel my class before
      or on the first day of class.
    </li>
  </ul>
